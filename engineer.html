    <h2> Secondary School Education</h2>
    <h3> For becoming an engineer, one must take PCM (physics,chemistry, mathematics) in secondary school.</h3><br><br>
    <h2> Identify the field of engineering you want to work in.</h2>
    <h3> Engineering is a broad and diverse field. 
        You could be a robotics engineer, a civil engineer, a chemical engineer, or one of many other varieties. 
        To identify the field you wish to work in, choose the field that interests you the most. 
        Alternately, choose the field with the best job prospects</h3><br> <br>
    <h2> Qualification</h2>
    <h3>Crack the JEE mains, and get the admission in an engineering college. For becoming an engineer you'll have to  earn a bachelor's degree.
         Many future engineers choose to pursue degrees in programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), which is the official organization that accredits engineering programs in the U.S. 
         You should get your bachelor's degree in the field of study you want to work in.
          Some engineering specialties may require you to have a master's degree in your specific field in addition to a bachelor's degree.</h3><br> <br>
    <h2>Take and pass the NCEES FE exam</h2>
    <h3> Once you graduate from an engineering program with a bachelor's degree, you can take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam offered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) to become licensed to work as an engineer-in-training or intern. 
   </h3><br><br>
    <h2>Obtain engineering experience</h2>
    <h3>After receiving your license from the NCEES FE exam, you can apply to work as an engineering intern or engineer-in-training. 
        You must obtain four years of on-the-job training for full licensure. </h3><br> <br>
    
    <h2>Take and pass the PE exam</h2>
    <h3> Once you have a minimum of a bachelor's degree and at least four years of experience, you can take the NCEES Professional Engineer (PE) exam to become licensed to work specifically in your discipline. Your career path may also require you to be licensed in more than one state, which means youâ€™ll need to apply for comity licensure in additional states through NCEES.</h3><br> <br>
  <h2> Apply for engineering jobs</h2>
    <h3> After passing the PE exam and becoming licensed as an engineer, you can begin applying for jobs in your field. Consider exploring industry-specific job boards or job search engines, or use your professional social networks to help you find a position. </h3>
