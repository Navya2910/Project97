       <h2>  Secondary School education</h2>
       <h3> To receive a quality medical education and become a doctor, you must graduate from secondary school with the required marks in all the subjects. 
        In your secondary level of education, you can select the core science subjects of physics, chemistry, and biology, as they are mandatory for admission into MBBS. 
        Knowledge of these core subjects is essential to qualify for the medical entrance examinations like NEET, AIIMS or JPIMER. 
        In-depth knowledge of these subjects can help you secure the desired rank in the entrance examination and gain admission in the medical school of your preference.</h3>
        <br><br>
      <h2>  Appear for an MBBS entrance exam</h2>
     <h3>   After you complete your 12th-grade examinations, you can appear for the required entrance exam to secure admission to a medical college. 
        In India, the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) is the most popular entrance exam, and most medical colleges accept its scores for admissions purposes. 
      Some colleges like  JPIMER, AIIMS, Kasturba Medical College, Maulana Azad Medical College and several others conduct their own entrance examinations. 
      Your admission to the medical college can be finalised after you pay the specified fees and submit the necessary documents.</h3>
        <br><br>
      <h2>  Complete your MBBS </h2>
       <h3> After your time in 12th grade is over, you can apply for MBBS, the first degree in the medical sciences that a person needs to become a doctor. 
        While many candidates do so directly after graduation, you are eligible to apply for the MBBS until you are 25 years old. 
        It is advisable to enrol in medical school within two years of completing your class 12th board exams. 
        The minimum age to be eligible for admission to the MBBS course is 17 years. 
        The minimum time period to become a doctor after completing grade 12 is five years and six months.
        After you complete the MBBS degree, you can be eligible to practice as a doctor. 
        You also have the option of pursuing a specialisation after the MBBS to further hone your skills and develop your techniques before finding a job in the field.</h3>
        <br><br>
       <h2> Complete an internship </h2>
       <h3> While earning an MBBS degree, candidates are usually required to complete a mandatory internship that takes place over one year. 
        During the internship, you can work under the supervision of senior doctors and work with patients who require different types of treatments. 
        In order to be eligible for the MBBS degree, you can demonstrate a satisfactory level of knowledge and skills during the mandatory internship.
         Some medical colleges have their own hospital wings where you can complete the internship, while others might require you to complete the internship at a specified hospital.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Register with the Indian Medical Register</h2>
      <h3>  In order to practice as a doctor in India, you need to register with any of the state medical council in India.
         Doctors who are registered with any state medical council are typically eligible to be registered under the Indian Medical Register. 
         In order to achieve eligibility, you can complete your MBBS degree and an internship from an institute recognized by the Medical Council of India. 
         After registering under the Indian Medical Register, you can start your career and begin practicing medicine in India.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h2> Practice as a doctor</h2>
        <h3>Once you complete your master's degree, you can typically opt for a second masters or even a PhD if you wish to gain more knowledge in the medical profession. 
            Many doctors choose to begin practising after their MBBS and a master's degree in medical science. When it comes to practice, there are two typical options. 
            The first one involves practising as an employee doctor in a specific healthcare institution, such as a multi-speciality hospital. 
            The second option is to practice independently in a clinic of your own or under the tutelage of a senior doctor.</h3>
