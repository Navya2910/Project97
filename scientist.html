<h2> Secondary School Education</h2>
<h3> If you are aiming to become a scientist it is best if you start your preparation right after school. 
    Choose your field of interest in science and narrow it down to a particular niche. However, the first step to the process is to choose between PCM or PCB right after your 10th board exams, it all depends on what kind of do you want to be. </h3>
<h2> Types of scientists </h2>
<h3> Astronomer </h3>
<h3> Botanist</h3>
<h3> Chemist</h3>
<h3>  Geneticist</h3>
<h3>Marinebiologist</h3>
<h3>Microbiologist</h3>
<h3>Physicist</h3>
<h3>Computer Scientist</h3>
<h3> Zoologist</h3>
<h3>Psychologist</h3>
<h3>Forensic Scientist</h3>
<h3>Regulatory Scientist </h3>

<h2> How to become an Astronomer ?</h2>
<h3> Student can do 12th Maths by choosing PCM. Then complete B.Sc in Physics. 
Further you can Proceed with M.Sc Physics/Astronomy/Astrophysics.
Further you can Proceed with Join Astronomy program and Ph.</h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Botanist?</h2>
<h3>Candidates aspiring to become a Botanist can take up courses at the UG, PG or Doctorate level such as BSc Botany, MSc Botany or PhD in Botany.
 Admission to the Botany Courses are usually done on the basis of merit list or entrance examination.
The average course fee ranges from INR 45,000-2,00,000 per annum.</h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Chemist ?</h2>
<h3> Complete a Bachelor degree in Science or Applied Science majoring in Chemistry.
 Look to secure a placement in an internship program while studying. This will provide you with relevant experience as well as guidance and mentorship from experienced Chemists.
Build your specialisation in one or more branches of the science of chemistry through continuing education and relevant industry experience.</h3><br><br>
<h2>How to become a Geneticist ?</h2>
<h3> Some of the top courses that can be pursued to become a Geneticist are BSc Biology, BTech Genetics Engineering, MSc Biology, MTech Genetics Engineering etc. 
Colleges such as SRM Engineering College, Sharda University, Chandigarh University, Jain University etc offers courses in BTech Genetics Engineering.</h3><br><br>
 <h2> How to become a Marinebiologist ?</h2>
<h3> Candidates must have completed a bachelor's degree in life sciences such as botany, aquaculture, marine biology, zoology, biochemistry, microbiology and biotechnology. 
The minimum pass percentage must be 55-60% in bachelor's degree. 
Universities offering M.Sc./M.</h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Microbiologist ?</h2>
<h3>To pursue this programme you need to have a B.Sc. degree in Microbiology, Botany, or Zoology. 
You can apply for PhD or M. Phil programmes after a postgraduate degree in Microbiology with minimum 50% aggregate marks. </h3><br><br>
<h2>How to become a Physicist ? </h2>
<h3>In order to become a Physicist students are required to pursue PhD in Physics for jobs in research and academia. 
    But an entry-level physicist can work with a bachelor's degree such as BSc in Physics. 
    There are several entrance exams that are conducted in order to become a Physicist, such as JEST, UGC-NET, GATE, etc. </h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Computer Scientist ?</h2>
    <h3> One of the prerequisites for becoming a computer scientist is to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science.
    Since a deep understanding of coding is crucial to becoming a successful computer scientist, you can look for internships and certificate courses on computing languages and coding. 
    Mentorship programs can help you gain insights into coding by working with experts who possess exceptional coding skills.
    While a bachelor’s degree may suffice for certain job roles, advanced roles in the field of computer sciences often require specialization, which you can achieve by pursuing a graduate or doctoral degree in computer sciences and specifically in certain topics, such as human-computer interactions, robotics, computer modeling, etc. 
    Doctoral degrees offer you a competitive edge as they instill research skills and also give you an opportunity to teach.
    The path to becoming a successful computer scientist starts with entry-level roles. You can apply for positions, such as software developer. This gives you an opportunity to develop skills very specific to advanced roles over time and secure a promotion to roles associated with a computer scientist. In fact, you can also gain some experience by seeking an entry-level position and then pursuing your doctoral degree.
</h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Zoologist ?</h2>
<h3> Zoology courses are offered at the graduate and postgraduate levels both full-time and part-time. Candidates can also opt for PhD in Zoology after completing their post-graduation. 
    Candidates in this discipline are basically taught animal anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, evolution, ecology, behaviour, and conservation.Career options after pursuing a BSc, MSc and PhD in Zoology are varied. Candidates find opportunities in government departments, environmental agencies, universities, colleges, biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and environmental/ecological fields.</h3><br> <br>
<h2>How to become a Psychologist ?</h2>
<h3>A Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS) degree is required in Psychology. 
    The curriculum focuses on personality development, psychotherapy, stress management, and neuro-psychology. Postgraduate specialisation is available, with an MA or M.Sc. in Psychology, Social Work, or Counselling</h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Forensic Scientist ?</h2>
<h3>Student can do 12(Science Stream). Then complete B.Sc in Forensic Sciences. Further you can Proceed with M.Sc in Forensic Sciences. Further you can Proceed with Ph.</h3><br><br>
<h2> How to become a Regulatory Scientist ?</h2>
<h3>In order to work as a pharmaceutical regulatory affairs specialist, most companies require a minimum of a Bachelor's Degree in science, preferably in chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacy, pharmacology, or pharmaceutical technology. </h3><br><br> 
<h2>Best Colleges and Universities </h2>
<h3>Jamia Millia Islamia</h3> 
<h3>Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore </h3>
<h3>Aligarh Muslim University </h3>
<h3>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi </h3>
<h3>Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi </h3>
